# BetterControllers

This project ***has not*** been tested on a RIO and is ***dangerous to be tested on live***. This should also be moved to its own repo after testing is complete if it works as intended. It also must be ported to CAN, and documentation should be written. Finally, there isn't much that BetterController currently adds, more features should be added. It's currently a concept that needs to be tested.
